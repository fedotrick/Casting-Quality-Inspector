# Control Metrics Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the control metrics system to support more flexible quality calculations and improve data integrity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `calculate_quality_metrics` Function
**File:** `app/services/control_service.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated function signature to accept optional parameters:
  ```python
  def calculate_quality_metrics(
      total_cast: Optional[int] = None, 
      total_accepted: Optional[int] = None, 
      defects_data: Optional[Dict[int, int]] = None,
      shift_id: Optional[int] = None
  ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
  ```

- **New behavior:**
  - When `shift_id` is provided, the function pulls statistics directly from `ControlRepository.get_shift_statistics()` and returns calculated metrics
  - When aggregate totals are provided (old signature), maintains backward compatibility

- **Return structure:**
  - Added `quality_rate` field (same as acceptance_rate for clarity)
  - Maintained `acceptance_rate` for backward compatibility
  - Returns: `total_cast`, `total_accepted`, `total_defects`, `reject_rate`, `quality_rate`, `acceptance_rate`

### 2. Extended `ControlRepository.get_shift_statistics`
**File:** `app/repositories/control_repository.py`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced to calculate and include additional metrics:
  - `total_defects`: Sum of all defects for the shift
  - `quality_rate`: Percentage of accepted parts (total_accepted / total_cast * 100)
  - `reject_rate`: Percentage of rejected parts (total_defects / total_cast * 100)

- **Return structure:**
  ```python
  {
      'total_records': int,
      'total_cast': int,
      'total_accepted': int,
      'total_defects': int,  # NEW
      'avg_quality': float,  # EXISTING (kept for backward compatibility)
      'quality_rate': float,  # NEW
      'reject_rate': float,  # NEW
      'defects': [...]
  }
  ```

### 3. Added Cascade Delete Options
**File:** `app/models/control.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated the relationship between `ЗаписьКонтроля` and `ДефектЗаписи`:
  ```python
  дефекты = relationship("ДефектЗаписи", back_populates="запись", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
  ```

- **Benefit:** When a control record is deleted, its associated defects are automatically cascade-deleted, maintaining referential integrity

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoint
**File:** `app/blueprints/api.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `/api/control/calculate` endpoint to support both calling patterns:
  - **New:** `POST /api/control/calculate` with `{"shift_id": 123}`
  - **Old:** `POST /api/control/calculate` with `{"total_cast": 100, "total_accepted": 95, "defects": {...}}`

- The endpoint now intelligently routes to the appropriate calculation method based on the presence of `shift_id` in the request

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain full backward compatibility:

1. **Function signature:** Old code calling `calculate_quality_metrics(total_cast, total_accepted, defects_data)` continues to work
2. **Return structure:** Old fields (`acceptance_rate`, `reject_rate`, etc.) are still present
3. **API endpoints:** Original API calls continue to function as before
4. **Repository methods:** `get_shift_statistics()` includes new fields while keeping all existing ones

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage added in:
- `tests/test_quality_metrics_enhancements.py` - New test file covering all enhancements
- All existing tests pass without modification
- Test coverage includes:
  - Calculate metrics with shift_id
  - Calculate metrics with aggregate totals (backward compatibility)
  - Enhanced repository statistics
  - Cascade delete functionality
  - API endpoint with both calling patterns

## Usage Examples

### Using shift_id (New)
```python
from app.services.control_service import calculate_quality_metrics

# Calculate metrics for a specific shift
metrics = calculate_quality_metrics(shift_id=123)
# Returns: {'total_cast': 200, 'total_accepted': 185, 'total_defects': 15,
#           'quality_rate': 92.5, 'reject_rate': 7.5, 'acceptance_rate': 92.5}
```

### Using aggregate totals (Backward Compatible)
```python
# Calculate metrics from aggregate values
metrics = calculate_quality_metrics(
    total_cast=100,
    total_accepted=95,
    defects_data={1: 5}
)
# Returns same structure as above
```

### API Usage with shift_id
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/control/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"shift_id": 123}'
```

### API Usage with totals (Backward Compatible)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/control/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"total_cast": 100, "total_accepted": 95, "defects": {"1": 5}}'
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility:** Can now calculate metrics either from a shift_id or from aggregate totals
2. **Consistency:** `quality_rate` and `reject_rate` are consistently calculated and available in both repository statistics and metric calculations
3. **Data Integrity:** Cascade delete ensures orphaned defect records don't accumulate
4. **Maintainability:** Centralized metric calculations reduce code duplication
5. **Backward Compatibility:** All existing code continues to work without modifications

## Migration Notes

No migration is required. The changes are:
- Additive (new fields, new parameters)
- Backward compatible (old signatures still work)
- Non-breaking (no existing functionality changed)
